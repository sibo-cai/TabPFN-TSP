# TabPFN-TSP
> A succinct but effective **TabPFN**-based **T**ime **S**eries forecasting method leveraging the intrinsic **P**eriodicity of data. The paper can be found [here](https://openreview.net/forum?id=7JGD1kNlzU). 

## Overview of the method
The method demonstrates the effectiveness of TabPFN in time series prediction tasks by integrating the intrinsic periodic patterns within time series data and refining the construction of input feature matrices.
